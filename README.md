<h1>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹</h1>

I love building websites. I primarily work with <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>React</b>, and <b>Node.js</b>. <b>JavaScript</b> is my favorite programming language. However, since I first learned how to program in 2014, I've utilized many different languages. This includes <b>Java</b>, <b>PHP</b>, <b>C#</b>, <b>C++</b>, and <b>Python</b>. I love to try different things, so naturally over time I've worked on a lot of different things. Besides websites and servers, I've hacked around with microcontrollers, IoT, video game engines, Windows applications, Android applications, and many console programs.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on an XR website where you can view historical stereoscopic photographs in their intended 3d. It's interesting working with such a different UI format.


ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out! I always appreciate feedback and opportunities to learn and improve.
