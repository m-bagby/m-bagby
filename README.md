<h1>Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<b>JavaScript</b> is my favorite programming language. However, since I first learned how to program in 2014, I've utilized many different languages. This includes <b>Java</b>, <b>C#</b>, <b>PHP</b>, <b>C++</b>, <b>PowerShell</b> and <b>Python</b>. I love to try different things, so naturally over time I've worked on a lot of different things. I've hacked around with websites, servers, microcontrollers, Windows applications, IoT, game engines, Android applications, and many console programs.


ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out! I always appreciate feedback and opportunities to learn and improve.
