<h1>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹</h1>

I love building websites. <b>JavaScript</b> is my favorite programming language and I primarily work with <b>React</b> and <b>Node.js</b>.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on wrapping up a collection of portfolio websites and finding a job.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning <b>TailwindCSS</b>. It's fun to use a new CSS framework and I love Tailwind's pragmatic approach. It offers my favorite part of <b>Bootstrap</b> - the utility classes - without all the bulk and overrides.

âš¡I'm excited to spend time working on my next project idea: a VR website where you can view historical stereoscopic photographs in 3d. It'll be a great opportunity work with React 360 and building a web app for that format will be really interesting.

Most of all, I'm excited to find work in an environment where I can cooperate with a team, adapt to new standards, absorb all I can, and grow as a developer.
