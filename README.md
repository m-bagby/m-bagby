<h1>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹</h1>

I love building websites. I primarily work with <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>React</b>, and <b>Node.js</b>. <b>JavaScript</b> is my favorite programming language. However, since I first learned how to program in 2014, I've utilized many different languages. This includes <b>Java</b>, <b>PHP</b>, <b>C#</b>, <b>C++</b>, and <b>Python</b>, all of which I've spent at least a few months with. I love to try different things, so naturally over time I've worked on a lot of different things. Besides websites and servers, I've hacked around with microcontrollers, video games, Windows applications, Android applications, and many, many console programs.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on wrapping up a collection of portfolio websites and finding a job.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning <b>TailwindCSS</b>. It's fun to use a new CSS framework and I love Tailwind's pragmatic approach. It offers my favorite part of <b>Bootstrap</b> - the utility classes - without all the bulk and overrides.

âš¡I'm excited to spend time working on my next project idea: a VR website where you can view historical stereoscopic photographs in 3d. It'll be a great opportunity work with React 360 and building a web app for that format will be really interesting.

Most of all, I'm excited to find work in an environment where I can cooperate with a team, adapt to new standards, absorb all I can, and grow as a developer.
